# Automation QA Assignment – Approach

## 🧠 Strategy

The project was structured to follow industry-standard automation practices using Python and Appium. A clear modular structure was created with separate directories for tests, utilities, screenshots, and logs.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Scripting language
- **Appium**: Mobile automation framework
- **Pytest**: Test runner
- **Allure**: Reporting framework

## ✅ Scenarios Covered

- App launch
- Navigation to Contact Us form
- Data entry in form with assertions
- Invalid login test case

## 📌 Highlights

- Custom logger used for better debugging
- Screenshot auto-capture on failure
- Structured test suite using `pytest.mark.order` for execution sequence

## 📈 Possible Improvements

- Add coverage for shopping cart and checkout flows
- Integrate CI pipeline (GitHub Actions or Jenkins)
- Add emulator start/stop to automation script
- Enhance validation logic and data-driven testing
